## Architecture

The extension is a thin bridge between two tools:

- **[Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)** provides the specification
  workflow (`/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.tasks`, etc.) and owns `.specify/`
- **[Squad](https://bradygaster.github.io/squad/)** manages a team of AI agents
  with declared capabilities and owns `.squad/`

```
Spec Kit artifacts          Squad artifacts
──────────────────          ───────────────
specs/<id>/spec.md  ──────► .squad/agents/{name}/charter.md
specs/<id>/tasks.md ──────► .squad/routing.md
                            .squad/team.md
                            squad.config.ts
```

Each command file in `commands/` is a Markdown prompt executed by the Spec Kit
runtime inside Claude Code. The commands shell out to the `squad` CLI for
operations that require Squad's agent management.

## CI Workflows

### `release.yml` — Semantic Release

Triggers on every push to `main` (and `workflow_dispatch`). Uses
[`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) with the following
plugin pipeline:

1. **`commit-analyzer`** — determines version bump from conventional commits
2. **`release-notes-generator`** — generates release notes
3. **`changelog`** — writes/updates `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
4. **`exec`** — updates `version:` in `extension.yml`
5. **`git`** — commits `docs/CHANGELOG.md` + `extension.yml` back with `[skip ci]`
6. **`github`** — creates the GitHub Release

Config: `.releaserc.json`

> **Requires** a `GH_TOKEN` repository secret (fine-grained Personal Access Token
> with contents/metadata read and write access to this repo) — `GITHUB_TOKEN`
> cannot push back to the branch.

### `lint.yml` — YAML + Markdown Linting

Triggers on push to non-main branches and on pull requests targeting `main`.
Lints all `.yml` files with `yamllint` and all `.md` files with
`markdownlint-cli2`. Configuration:

- `.yamllint.yml` — relaxed line length, truthy disabled
- `.markdownlint.json` — MD013 (line length) and MD033 (inline HTML) disabled

### `test.yml` — Extension Smoke Tests

Triggers on push to non-main branches and on pull requests targeting `main`.
Validates that all command files referenced in `extension.yml` exist and that
`extension.yml` parses as valid YAML.

### `catalog-submit.yml` — Spec Kit Catalog Submission

Triggers on every release publish and on `workflow_dispatch` (with an optional
`tag` input for resubmission). On each run it:

1. Renders `.github/templates/catalog-submission.md.j2` via
   `.github/scripts/build-catalog-submission.py` — all values sourced from
   `extension.yml`, nothing hardcoded
2. Closes any previously open catalog submission issues (to avoid stale entries)
3. Opens a new issue on `github/spec-kit` with the rendered body

> **Requires** a `PUBLIC_REPO_TOKEN` repository secret — a classic Personal
> Access Token with `public_repo` scope. Fine-grained PATs cannot create issues
> on third-party public repositories.
